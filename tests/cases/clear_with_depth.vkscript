# This probe causes the pipeline clear to be executed, exercising the depth-stencil support.
# However, there is no way to read a depth-stencil attachment directly, so we can't probe its output.
# We would need a second pipeline or a depth test on the pipeline to observe the effects of the
# depth-stencil clear.
